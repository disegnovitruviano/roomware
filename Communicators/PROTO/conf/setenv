# Before the scripts run, this will set a proper Java environment
# Please edit this values, and you are not supposed to edit these in

#
# Installation DIR
#
# This should point to the Roomware installation directory
#
ROOMWARE_PATH="$HOME/Projects/RoomWare/Server"
#
#
# If you have the normal RoomWare layout this should point to the
# RoomWare server class files.
#
ROOMWARE_LIB="$ROOMWARE_PATH/lib/RoomWareServer.jar"
#
# The module package name
# 
COMMUNICATOR_NAME="PROTO"
#
# And you should edit this to the path of your module
#
COMMUNICATOR_PATH="$HOME/Projects/RoomWare/Communicators/$COMMUNICATOR_NAME"
#
# EXECUTABLES
# 
# - This section will point to executables. For most systems the executables
#   shouldnt be adjusted.
#
# - If you point to an executable, the absolute path can be ommited if the
#   executable is located in a directory that has been included in the PATH
#   environment variable.

#
# 1. Java Runtime Environment
#
#    REQUIRED: yes
#    VERSION : at least 1.5
#    DOWNLOAD: see 'Java Development Kit'
#
#    Every modern computer/operating system comes with a java virtual
#    machine (Java Runtime Environment). You should pass the name of
#    the java virtual machine binary.
#
#    If you still need one, it will be included by the Java SE Development
#    Kit, see 'The Java Compiler'.
#
JAVA="java"
#
#
# 2. Java Development Kit / The Java Compiler
#
#    REQUIRED: only for making changes to the roomware source code
#    VERSION : at least 1.5 (Standard Edition)
#    DOWNLOAD: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
#
#    The JDK comes with the java source code and a compiler which enables
#    you to build java class files, suitable for the Java Runtime Environment.
#    The JAVAC variable should point to your java compiler.
#    The JAR variable should point to your java archive utility.
#
#    If you have a normal end user install, the Java Development Kit (JDK)
#    is not provided. You can download it from Sun Microsystems' website.
#
#    Use the Java 2 Second Edition version >= 1.5 (newest recommended).
#    Java comes in multiple versions: Micro Edition (J2ME), Standard Edition
#    (J2SE) and Enterprise Edition (J2EE). The J2ME is developed for small
#    limited mobile devices and won't give you 'the Java' on your normal
#    computer. Don't download this version for use with this distribution of
#    the Roomware server. It simply won't work.
#    The Enterprise Edition is a super set (it contains every thing that the
#    J2SE contains, but even more...) so you can use this. It uses the same
#    Java Virtual Machine in contrast to the J2ME.
#
JAVAC="javac"
JAR="jar"

# export the variable for the roomware environment
