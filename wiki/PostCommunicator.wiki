#summary How to setup your roomware server to post events to a script as they happen

= Introduction =

With the latest version of the Roomware server we now support the posting of events directly to an URI. This allows you to write an application that reacts on events as they ahppen in realtime as opposed to polling an XML file for changes.

To start using the Post Communicator you simple add the post communicator to your list of communicators:

{{{
communicators: console, http, post
}}}

The name you chose for your communicator will still have to be attached to the class that contains the communicator code:

{{{
post-class: org.roomwareproject.communicator.post.Communicator
}}}

And finally you will have to set the configuration options for your new Communicator:

{{{
# post class definition
post-host: 192.168.2.152
post-port: 9019
post-path: /eventlist.php
}}}

The above configuration will post the following URI: `http://192.168.2.152:9019/eventlist.php`.

After you've got that working you could even go really wild and add another post communicator that posts events to another URI entrirely! Madness we know...

{{{
# comma seperated list of communicators to load
communicators: console, http, post, post2

post2-class: org.roomwareproject.communicator.post.Communicator
post2-host: 192.168.2.152
post2-port: 9019
post2-path: /debug.php
}}}
