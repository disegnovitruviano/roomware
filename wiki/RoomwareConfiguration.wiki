#summary How to configure your roomware server

= Introduction =

So you've downloaded all those good looking JARs and now your looking to play with them right? We'll you can't right away. First you'll need to configure your server a bit.

Were working on a system taht will automatically load any modules you might want to use but for now it's a bit of typing thats needed.


= Details =

This instruction presumes that you have already setup your environemnt variables and copied the module and communicator JAR files into their respective directories.

In your Server/conf/ directory you'll find the following congiguration file; roomware.conf

In a standard setup with the bluetooth module and the http communicator loaded your config file will have to include the following lines at a minimum:

{{{
# C O M M U N I C A T O R S
#

httpcomm.Communicator
httpcomm-class: httpcomm.Communicator
console.Communicator
console-class: console.Communicator

# M O D U L E S
#
# First, you must define a name for every instance of a module to be loaded.

bluemod.Module
bluemod-class: bluemod.Module

#modules:	blue
#
# Now we do the same for the communicators
#
#communicators:	console, http

modules: bluemod
communicators: httpcomm

# stop-on-error: 'false' || 'true'
#
stop-on-error:	true

}}}

With this config and the JARs in place you should be well on your way. Now just follow along with the instal guide again: http://roomwareproject.org/pages/download

have fun!
