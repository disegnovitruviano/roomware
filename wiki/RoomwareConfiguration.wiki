#summary How to configure your roomware server

= Introduction =

So you've downloaded all those good looking JARs and now your looking to play with them right? We'll you can't right away. First you'll need to configure your server a bit.

Were working on a system that will automatically load any modules you might want to use but for now it's a bit of typing thats needed.


= Details =

This instruction presumes that you have already setup your environemnt variables and copied the module and communicator JAR files into their respective directories.

In your Server/conf/ directory you'll find the following congiguration file; roomware.conf

In a standard setup with the bluetooth module and the http communicator loaded your config file will have to include the following lines at a minimum:

*updated: to account for Tom's suggestion in the comments*

{{{
# C O M M U N I C A T O R S
console-class:	console.Communicator
httpcomm-class:	httpcomm.Communicator

# M O D U L E S
bluemod-class:	bluemod.Module

# PARAMETERS - AS MANY AS DESIRED
#
#siwa-message:	Hello, World!
bluemod-update-interval-time = 20
bluemod-device-clear-time = 30


# S E R V E R

modules: bluemod
communicators: console, httpcomm

#
# stop-on-error: 'false' || 'true'
#
stop-on-error:	true
}}}

With this config and the JARs in place you should be well on your way. Now just follow along with the instal guide again: http://roomwareproject.org/pages/download
