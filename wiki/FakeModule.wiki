= Introduction =

This is really a short description of the fake module, quoted from email:

_While working on a communicator, you probably want to test some
special cases with some devices. E.g. no devices, 1 device or many
devices. Or maybe devices with particular names (I needed it for this
case). You could ofcourse try to grab 10+ bluetooth devices and do it,
but maybe to edited only the roomware server configuration file is
more easy then constantly changing your bluetooth friendly name on
your mobile._

= Install =

1. Add the [FakeModule Module_Fake]-1.0.1.jar to your modules directory.

2. Add the RoomWare_Server-1.0.0.jar to your lib directory.

= Configuration =

1. Add a new module to the roomware server configuration (eg. 'fake'):
   modules: _list, of, previous, modules_, *fake*

2. Load the module class for the 'fake' module:
   fake-class: *org.roomwareproject.module.fake.Module*

3. You *must* define the devices:
   fake-devices: test1, 0123456789

4. You *can* add a friendly name to a device:
   fake-0123456789-name: my simple demo device that has address 0123456789
